            <p>The world seems to stand still when you are told. That feeling you have never felt before, of total
                sadness.
                You feel faint and dazed as if you are falling or dreaming. You were told this was going to happen, but
                you
                could never be prepared for it. You don't know what to say, you are totally speechless. You burn up,
                feel
                dizzy but no tears will come. You have to get out of there, to escape, runaway anything to make this
                feeling
                fade. You just don't want to believe it had happened after everything. Part of you wants to cry your
                heart
                out and the other part wants to hit something with the anger that raging inside you.</p>
